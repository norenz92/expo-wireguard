# expo-wireguard

## Description
This is an expo native module that makes it possible for us to add native code to our react native project.
We also use Expo config plugin to modify native projects.

## Example app
We have an example app located in /example. Here we can test our expo package.
Never edit files under /example/ios or /example/android.

## Important
- Try to use the expo config plugins as far as possible. Scripts should only be used in worst case.
- Implement iOS for now. We'll do Android later.
